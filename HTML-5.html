    <h1>This is the top-level header. Only use me once!</h1>
    <h2>Section 1: Outside elements</h2>
    <h3>Section 1.1: Links</h3>
    <p>
        This is a section under a second-level heading using a paragraph element. Now let's add a couple links in a numbered list under this paragraph. We're going to make: a link that targets to a blank page, a dead link, and an internal link to an element on this page.
    </p>

    <!--Make an Ordered List-->
    <ol>
        <li>Link 1: <a target="_blank" href="http://freecodecamp.org">to a blank page</a></li>
        <li>Link 2: <a href="#">a dead link</a></li>
        <li>Link 3: <a href="#footer">a link to the footer</a></li>
    </ol>
        
    <p>
        In the next section, we'll add photos to a page, and even make a photo a link that you can click on.
    </p>

    <h3> Section 1.2: Images</h3>
    <p>
        This is a section under a third-level heading using a paragraph element. Let's put a bulleted list under this paragraph that covers what we'll add to this section in HTML:
    </p>

    <!--Make an Un-ordered List-->
    <ul>
        <li>We'll add a photo to this section.</li>
        <li>We'll assign the photo alternate text that screen readers and search engines can read.</li>
        <li>We'll even make a photo into a link.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Here's our regular image with alternate text assigned for accessibility:
    </p>
    
    <img source="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,h_1414,w_2101,x_20,y_0/v1565279671/shape/mentalfloss/578211-gettyimages-542930526.jpg?" alt="a tabby cat with wide orange eyes">

    <p>
        Now let's include a photo that's also a link:
    </p>

   <!--Remember to put photos between the a tags-->
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.austinpetsalive.org/">
        <img source="https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/58-582775_free-icons-png-orange-cat-transparent-background.png" alt="an orange cat with its paw raised">
   </a>

   <p>Click the cat to adopt from APA!</p>

    <h2>Section 2: Interactive Elements</h2>
    <p>
        Here's a new section under another second-level heading. We'll put elements that allow someone browsing your web page to interact with it by sending it data.
    </p>

    <h3>Section 2.1: Input Box</h3>
    <p>
        You can make a box where a user can type an answer and send it to the server hosting your website. We'll do this by creating an input field and adding a "submit" button to it.
    </p>
    
    <!--Make a form element that sends the input data to a page-->
    <form action="/search"><!--The string text is a URL slug for your site-->
        <!--Makes a search bar section:-->
        <input type="test" placeholder="type in a search word">
        <!--Remember to put the button text in bewteen tags-->
        <button type="submit">Go!</button>
    </form>

    <p>
        If you want to make an input box required (like if you're creating a page with a form and someone needs to fill out their name), just add "required" to the input tag.
    </p>

    <!--Makes form fields with mandatory input-->
    <form action="/info"><!--Remember to place in a form tag-->
        <input type="text" required placeholder="Name">
        <input type="text" required placeholder="Email">
        <p>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
        </p>

    <h3>Section 2.2: Radio Buttons</h3>
    <p>
        Use radio buttons to let a user choose from predetermined options:
    </p>
    <form action="/answers">
        <p>
            Cats are:
            <p>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="objective-test">Amazing
            </label>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="objective-test">Perfect
            </label> 
    </form>
   

</main>

<footer id="footer">
