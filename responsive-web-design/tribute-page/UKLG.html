            Ursula K. Le Guin was one of the greatest writers of all time and was especially well known for her works of speculative and science fiction. Her literary career spanned some 60 years, over which she wrote more than 20 novels and 100 short stories. Her most widely beloved books include the <i>Earthsea</i> series, <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>, and <i>The Dispossessed</i>. Le Guin became the first woman to earn the Hugo and Nebula awards for science fiction, winning both awards for <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, published in 1968. Several of her works have gone on to become television, film, and stage adaptations. She has been a major influence and inspiration among authors, especially within the science fiction community.

            Born in 1929, in Berkeley, California, Le Guin grew up in a scholarly family. Her father was an anthropologist and a professor at The University of California; her mother had a graduate degree in psychology and became a writer herself. Le Guin grew up receiving well-known academics as visitors and enjoyed a large library at home. From the time she was a child, Le Guin was fond of science fiction, fantasy, mythology, and legends. She was also influenced by her parents' own academic backgrounds in anthrpologogy and psychology, making use of both perspectives in her work. She submitted her first short story when she was just 11, though her work was rejected.

            Le Guin studied Renaissance French and Italian literature at Radcliffe College, graduating with a Bachelors of Arts in 1951. She went on to earn a Master of Arts in French at Columbia University. She earned Fulbright grants to continue studying French in France, but stopped pursuing her doctorate degree after she married her husband, a professor of history, in 1953. Le Guin later raised two daughters and one son in Portland, Oregon, where she lived the rest of her life. She died in 2018.
