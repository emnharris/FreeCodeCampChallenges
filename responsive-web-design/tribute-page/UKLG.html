                    "Yes, I write science fiction. No, I'm not only a science fiction writer. Don't box me in! However, I will get provocative and say I am a Western writer, because we need to redefine that category.

                <p>    
                    Then they say, 'So you write westerns?' and I say no. I am a Western writer. I was born in the West and lived most of my life here. I write as a Westerner.

                <p>
                    And I will say yes, I am a woman writer. I finally learned how to say that when I was in my fifties. I am a woman writer, not an imitation man."

                <h2>
                    Her Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ursula K. Le Guin was one of the greatest writers of all time and was especially well known for her works of speculative and science fiction. Her literary career spanned some 60 years, over which she wrote more than 20 novels and 100 short stories. Her most widely beloved books include the <i>Earthsea</i> series, <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>, and <i>The Dispossessed</i>. Le Guin became the first woman to earn the Hugo and Nebula awards for science fiction, winning both awards for <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, published in 1968. Several of her works have gone on to become radio, television, film, and stage adaptations. She has been a major influence and inspiration among authors, especially within the science fiction community.

                    Born in 1929, in Berkeley, California, Le Guin grew up in a scholarly family. Her father was an anthropologist and a professor at The University of California; her mother had a graduate degree in psychology and became a writer herself. Le Guin and her siblings enjoyed a large  library at home, and her family often received well-known academics as visitors. From the time she was a child, Le Guin was fond of science fiction, fantasy, mythology, and legends. She was also influenced by her parents' own academic backgrounds in anthropology and psychology, making use of both perspectives in her work. She submitted her first short story to a publication when she was just 11, though her work was rejected.

                    Le Guin studied Renaissance French and Italian literature at Radcliffe College, graduating with a Bachelors of Arts in 1951. She went on to earn a Master of Arts in French at Columbia University. She earned Fulbright grants to continue studying French in France, but stopped pursuing her doctorate degree after she married her husband, a professor of history, in 1953. Le Guin later raised two daughters and one son in Portland, Oregon, where she lived the rest of her life. She died in 2018.

                <p>
                    Le Guin was known for holding fast to her principles and taking political stances with her work. Themes of gender and sexuality, moral development, and alternative political systems are frequently found in her work. Her peers have called attention to her "outspoken sense of justice, decency, and common sense." In 1977, she refused a Nebula Award for her story "The Diary of the Rose" in protest of a member of the committee whom she viewed as willing to support the politically intolerant Soviet Union. In 2009, she resigned from the Authors Guild in protest of their endorsement of Google's digitization project, which was controversial regarding the concept of copyright. In a speech at the 2014 National Book Awards, Le Guin criticized Amazon and the control it exerted over the publishing industry.
