                <h3>4.1. Introduction </h3>
                <p>Repetition structures are methods for forcing a program to re-run lines of code rather than repeating the code in sequence.</p>

                <p>Benefits of repetitive structures include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>shorter, simpler code</li>
                    <li>less likelihood for mistakes</li>
                    <li>greater ease in implementing widespread changes</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>One repetition of a repetitive statement is called an <i>iteration</i>.</p>

                <p>Examples of repetition structures include <code>while</code> loops and <code>for</code> loops, discussed on this page below.</p>

                <h3>4.2. <code>while</code> loops</h3>
                <p>The most syntactically simple repetitive structure is a <code>while</code> loop. These loops are <i>condition-controlled</i> loops. They are made up of two components: a condition which they test for, and a statement they execute on a loop. Because <code>while</code> loops check whether a condition is true or false <b>before</b> running, they are also known as <i>pre-test loops</i>.</p>

                <p>A <code>while</code> loop will only end if a condition changes within its statement which causes its run condition to become false. If no such condition exists, it will become an <i>infinite loop</i>, a loop that will never stop running.</p>
