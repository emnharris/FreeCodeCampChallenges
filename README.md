# FreeCodeCampChallenges
This repository is a collection of challenges I've completed through FreeCodeCamp.org, a free 2000-hour curruculum for web development. FreeCodeCamp offers 10 subject areas that are 300 hours of curriculum each. Building 5 projects is required to earn a certification in any area.

## Responsive Web Design projects
Each of the pages I built to complete this certification were created solely with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript without the use of any frameworks.

The easiest way to view these pages in your web browser is by following the GitHub Pages links below. You can also locally clone this repository, which contains all of the HTML index files and CSS style files, then open any of the HTML files to view the web page.

I ran into some interesting challenges while creating a few of these pages, which I've documented in [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/emnharris/FreeCodeCampChallenges/wiki).

* **Challenge 1:** [Build a tribute page](https://emnharris.github.io/FreeCodeCampChallenges/responsive-web-design/tribute-page/UKLG.html)

* **Challenge 2:** [Build a survey form](https://emnharris.github.io/FreeCodeCampChallenges/responsive-web-design/survey-page/survey.html)

* **Challenge 3:** [Build a landing page](https://emnharris.github.io/FreeCodeCampChallenges/responsive-web-design/landing-page/GCCC.html)

* **Challenge 4:** [Build a technical documentation page](https://emnharris.github.io/FreeCodeCampChallenges/responsive-web-design/technical-documentation-page/python-tutorial.html)

* **Challenge 5:** [Build a personal portfolio page](https://emnharris.github.io/FreeCodeCampChallenges/responsive-web-design/portfolio/portfolio.html)
