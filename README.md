# FreeCodeCampChallenges
A collection for the challenges I complete through freecodecamp.org. I'm currently working on the Responsive Web Design Certification.

## Responsive Web Design projects
This repo contains the actual HTML and CSS files, but you can view the pages directly in your browser with GitHub Pages by following these links. I created each of these pages solely with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript without the use of any frameworks. I plan on doing a Bootstrap tutorial once I finish this certification.
